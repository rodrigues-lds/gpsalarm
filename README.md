The GPS alarm application will sound to alert a person when they are near the bus stop based on their location.
It is intended for those employees who take the shuttle bus to work at the office and miss the bus stop because they fall asleep constantly on the road.
It will benefit the company because employees take too much time trying to get to work because they lose their bus.
